# The Repository

I've created this repository with the intention of storing my material created for the Spring 2020 version of Stanford University's course CS193p (Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI).

# The Course

"Stanford's CS193p course, Developing Applications for iOS, explains the fundamentals of how to build applications for iPhone and iPad using SwiftUI."

You can access the course lectures through this [link](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu).
